<n2>Protocol</n2>
### Blueprint

In the realm of daily life and the ever-changing quest for efficiency, it’s crucial to maintain a routine. This routine is a dynamic entity, always updating as we uncover new information and make fresh discoveries. As I pursue this knowledge, I have created the most optimal sequences for each of the relevant aspects of my daily routine called *protocols*. Now, let’s take a look at its current state.

<n2>Rules & Constraints</n2>
### Regulating

Within the domain of your daily routines and the unending pursuit of efficiency, it remains vital to keep in mind the existing rules and constraints concerning the various addictions and activities that deplete your time.

1. Moderate use of social media by only checking YouTube and Instagram home/explore/reels once per day segment for a maximum of ten minutes. All other apps are to only be used for messaging people.
2. Do not expend energy on people who are not in your life.

<n2>Thankfulness</n2>
### Gratitude

Gratitude, a profound acknowledgement of the blessings within our lives, serves as an essential element in the ongoing refinement of our routines and protocols. Now, as we delve into the examination of our current state, let gratitude be our steadfast companion on this journey.

<n2>Visualisation</n2>
### Goals

Visualise having already achieved your long-term goals. Create a vision board, and add a number and label to each item. Split the board into long-term long-term goals and short-term long-term goals, ideally 12 months ahead.

Visualise yourself doing actions that will help you move closer towards these goals. If you don't know what actions to take, visualise yourself finding out. Visualise being successful with it.

Use inner intention to execute the process, and outer intention to operate from the end state of the assumption of already having achieved the goal. The processes are not static.

**Research:** visualise ideal self, embodiment.
