### Thanks

In the spirit of gratitude, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to individuals who have greatly inspired and contributed to my journey. *Andrew Huberman*, your profound insights into neuroscience and human potential have been a guiding light. *Lex Fridman*, your dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and meaningful conversations has been truly enlightening. *Bryan Johnson*, your visionary thinking and commitment to advancing humanity's future have been a constant source of inspiration. I am deeply appreciative of the wisdom and inspiration you have all shared, which have enriched my understanding and perspective in countless ways.

I would also like to express a special and profound gratitude to my mother, who played an invaluable role in shaping my journey of knowledge and well-being. She shared her wisdom long before I embarked on my own research. Her nurturing guidance and unwavering support have been a foundation upon which I've built my quest for understanding. Mum, your love and teachings have been an enduring source of inspiration, and I'm immensely grateful for the wisdom you've imparted. Thank you for instilling in me the importance of seeking knowledge and embracing the treasures of herbal medicine.
