> *“Your body is a temple, your mind is a garden, your soul is a mirror.” - Unknown*

Let it be known that this work does not possess all the answers. Rather, it humbly invites you, dear reader, to embark on a journey to forge your own path towards enlightenment. For it is through the process of introspection, self-awareness, and the pursuit of virtue that one can attain a profound sense of harmony amidst the chaos of existence. May you discover the strength to navigate the trials and tribulations of life with grace and resilience.

### Dentistry

Brush teeth twice daily using an electric toothbrush, utilising a tongue scraper and practising regular dental flossing. Gargle warm salt solution each night. Use [miswak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gyLDGaKUGs), or *Salvadora persica* sticks, following every meal or snack. Maintain correct tongue posture and [mew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmf-pR7EryY) correctly as often as remembered.

**Ongoing research:** fluoride-free toothpaste.

### Dermatology

Shower daily, utilising soap to cleanse the entire body beyond mere hand and armpit gestures. Pay heed to the often-neglected zones: the nape, the ears, the feet, the ankles, and the back. Additionally, retract the foreskin and cleanse with the thumb, and spread the gluteal muscles apart and cleanse between. Use a scalp scrubber with shampoo and allow conditioner to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. Cleanse hands thoroughly after using the toilet. Take a cold shower and wash hands after engaging in physical activity at the gym.

Maintain tidiness with a nose hair trimmer and use tweezers to groom eyebrows. Paying close attention to the area just beneath the mandibular angle when shaving. Remove chest hair, tend to axillary hair with trimming, and manage pubic hair by shaving the testes and shaft, trimming the pubic region, and plucking thigh hair as needed. Ensure nails remain consistently trimmed.

Moisturise daily and if incorporating retinol every other day into the skincare regimen, select moisturiser with SPF for optimal protection.

Wear fresh undergarments and socks on a daily basis. Launder pillowcases and bedsheets regularly.

**Ongoing research:** face yoga, gua sha, sugar, posture, african wash net.

### Mobility

Maintaining joint mobility and muscle flexibility is crucial for prophylaxis against age-related orthopaedic conditions. The process of ageing involves cartilage and synovial fluid degradation, and reduced muscle elasticity, leading to issues such as osteoarthritis. *Surya Namaskar* is an efficient routine targeting flexibility, strength, and balance, with origins traced back to the Vedic period in India. Each of the twelve poses in the cycle must be mastered to perfection to achieve optimal benefits, including the eye movements and diaphragmatic breathing.

**Ongoing research:** Chandra Namaskar.

### Strength

**Ongoing research:** weightlifting, long-distance running, boxing.

### Sexual Stamina

Mastery over sexual stamina requires proficiency in the following four domains: (1) achieving a balance in the power and tone of the pelvic floor muscles, (2) utilising diaphragmatic breathing, (3) developing a 'calm arousal' state of mind, and (4) conditioning the body through the practice of edging.

**1** As the male orgasm nears, the pubococcygeus muscle begins to tense. Therefore, actively relaxing the pubococcygeus muscle prevents the natural tension build up required for ejaculation. During orgasm, the bulbospongiosus muscle, or bulbocavernosus muscle, rhythmically flexes to empty the urethra. Therefore, tensing the muscle leads to faster ejaculation, though it results in a stronger erection. When an individual lacks muscle control, the bulbospongiosus and pubococcygeus muscles may contract involuntariy, relaxing the pubococcygeus can delay reaching the point of no return.

Firstly, an individual must learn to relax and contract both muscles independently by practicing the following four exercises, holding each contraction for 3 seconds and incrementally increasing the duration each week: (1) Front Pelvic Drops (Front Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if forcefully expelling urine faster during urination.
(2) Front Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if halting the flow of urine mid-stream.
(3)Back Pelvic Drops (Back Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if pushing out flatulence.
(4) Back Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if restraining bowel movement or holding in flatulence.

Depending on how imbalanced the pelvic floor already is, exclusively performing Reverse Kegels will allow overcorrection of the imbalance.

**3** A negative emotional state causes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and the consumption of pornography causes overstimulation, both of which lower the threshold to reach the point of no return.

Areas of ongoing research: diaphragmatic breathing.

### Diet

**Ongoing research:** organic foods, cast iron, microwave, spring water, organic coconut water, cistanche, shilajit, apricot seeds, chlorella and spirulina.

### Psychosociology

The most beautiful sound a person can hear is their own name.

Avoid tortured meat because the negative emotion and negative energy will transfer. The Vedas say it is better to be a vegetarian.

Help people where you can.

**Ongoing research:** body language, manifestation.
