### Dentistry

Mechanical plaque control, achieved by creating friction between toothbrush bristles or Miswak plant fibers and the tooth surface, involves cleaning teeth with an electric toothbrush twice daily and using *Salvadora persica* sticks after every meal or snack. Toothpaste containing CoQ10 and Miswak contributes to chemical plaque control through the presence of calcium and fluoride ions, promoting the remineralization of tooth structure and exhibiting mild antibacterial properties.

*Salvadora persica*, commonly known as Miswak, offers a range of components with specific roles in oral health. Silica acts as an abrasive material, effectively removing stains and deposits from the tooth surface. Sodium bicarbonate provides a mild abrasive and germicidal effect, while tannic acid has an astringent effect on the mucous membrane. Resins form a protective physical layer over the enamel, guarding it against microbial action. Alkaloids exhibit bactericidal properties and stimulate the gingiva, essential oils act as antiseptics and enhance saliva production, similar to the effects of tea tree oil mouthwash. Additionally, vitamin C aids in the healing and repair process. This comprehensive approach helps to eliminate the biofilm of plaque, containing bacteria that secrete acid leading to enamel erosion and the formation of cavities, or causing gum infections such as gingivitis.

A tongue scraper removes the thin film of debris and bacteria that accumulates on the surface of the tongue. Gently scraping the tongue's surface reduces bacteria and foul odors.

Dental flossing plays a crucial role in oral health by cleaning the tight spaces between teeth and along the gumline that a toothbrush may not effectively reach. Dental floss removes food particles and plaque from these areas, preventing the formation of cavities and gum disease. It also promotes healthy gums by reducing the risk of inflammation and bleeding.

Salt gargling, a practice rooted in traditional medicine, involves rinsing the mouth with a warm saline solution. The saltwater rinse helps create an inhospitable environment for bacteria by altering the pH balance in the mouth. Additionally, it can soothe minor gum irritations and provide temporary relief from a sore throat or mouth ulcers.

**Ongoing research:** Tea tree oil.

### Dermatology

Shower daily, utilising soap to cleanse the entire body beyond mere hand and armpit gestures. Pay heed to the often-neglected zones: the nape, the ears, the feet, the ankles, and the back. Additionally, retract the foreskin and cleanse with the thumb, and spread the gluteal muscles apart and cleanse between. Use a scalp scrubber with shampoo and allow conditioner to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. Cleanse hands thoroughly after using the toilet. Take a cold shower and wash hands after engaging in physical activity at the gym.

Maintain tidiness with a nose hair trimmer and use tweezers to groom eyebrows. Paying close attention to the area just beneath the mandibular angle when shaving. Remove chest hair, tend to axillary hair with trimming, and manage pubic hair by shaving the testes and shaft, trimming the pubic region, and plucking thigh hair as needed. Ensure nails remain consistently trimmed.

Moisturise daily and if incorporating retinol every other day into the skincare regimen, select moisturiser with SPF for optimal protection.

Wear fresh undergarments and socks on a daily basis. Launder pillowcases and bedsheets regularly.

**Ongoing research:** Face yoga, gua sha, sugar, posture, african wash net.

### Mobility

Maintaining joint mobility and muscle flexibility is crucial for prophylaxis against age-related orthopaedic conditions. The process of ageing involves cartilage and synovial fluid degradation, and reduced muscle elasticity, leading to issues such as osteoarthritis. *Surya Namaskar* is an efficient routine targeting flexibility, strength, and balance, with origins traced back to the Vedic period in India. Each of the twelve poses in the cycle must be mastered to perfection to achieve optimal benefits, including the eye movements and diaphragmatic breathing.

**Ongoing research:** Chandra Namaskar.

### Sexual Stamina

Mastery over sexual stamina requires proficiency in the following four domains: (1) achieving a balance in the power and tone of the pelvic floor muscles, (2) utilising diaphragmatic breathing, (3) developing a 'calm arousal' state of mind, and (4) conditioning the body through the practice of edging.

**1** As the male orgasm nears, the pubococcygeus muscle begins to tense. Therefore, actively relaxing the pubococcygeus muscle prevents the natural tension build up required for ejaculation. During orgasm, the bulbospongiosus muscle, or bulbocavernosus muscle, rhythmically flexes to empty the urethra. Therefore, tensing the muscle leads to faster ejaculation, though it results in a stronger erection. When an individual lacks muscle control, the bulbospongiosus and pubococcygeus muscles may contract involuntariy, relaxing the pubococcygeus can delay reaching the point of no return.

Firstly, an individual must learn to relax and contract both muscles independently by practicing the following four exercises, holding each contraction for 3 seconds and incrementally increasing the duration each week: (1) Front Pelvic Drops (Front Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if forcefully expelling urine faster during urination.
(2) Front Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if halting the flow of urine mid-stream.
(3)Back Pelvic Drops (Back Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if pushing out flatulence.
(4) Back Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if restraining bowel movement or holding in flatulence.

Depending on how imbalanced the pelvic floor already is, exclusively performing Reverse Kegels will allow overcorrection of the imbalance.

**3** A negative emotional state causes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and the consumption of pornography causes overstimulation, both of which lower the threshold to reach the point of no return.

**Ongoing research:** diaphragmatic breathing.

### Diet

**Ongoing research:** Organic foods, cast iron, microwave, spring water, organic coconut water, cistanche, shilajit, apricot seeds, chlorella and spirulina.

### Psychosociology

The most beautiful sound a person can hear is their own name.

Avoid tortured meat because the negative emotion and negative energy will transfer. The Vedas say it is better to be a vegetarian.

Help people where you can.

**Ongoing research:** Body language, manifestation.
