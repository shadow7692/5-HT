<n2>Thankfulness</n2>
### Gratitude

In the spirit of gratitude, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to individuals who have greatly inspired and contributed to my journey. *Andrew Huberman, Lex Fridman, Bryan Johnson, Quazi Johir, Mike Mew, Andrew Tate, Tristan Tate*. I am deeply appreciative of the wisdom and inspiration you have all shared, which have enriched my understanding and perspective in countless ways.

I would also like to express a special and profound gratitude to my mother, who played an invaluable role in shaping my journey of knowledge and well-being. She shared her wisdom long before I embarked on my own research. Her nurturing guidance and unwavering support have been a foundation upon which I've built my quest for understanding. Mum, your love and teachings have been an enduring source of inspiration, and I'm immensely grateful for the wisdom you've imparted. Thank you for instilling in me the importance of seeking knowledge and embracing the treasures of herbal medicine. The companionship of my dear friends and loving siblings has been a constant source of joy, encouragement, and strength throughout the chapters of my life.

Being in good health is a privilege that often goes unnoticed until it's compromised. I'm profoundly thankful for the vitality that allows me to embrace each day with enthusiasm and to explore the wonders of this world. I'm grateful for the beauty of nature that surrounds us, for the moments of serenity found in a gentle breeze or the vibrant hues of a sunset.

Gratitude, a profound acknowledgement of the blessings within our lives, serves as an essential element in the ongoing refinement of our routines and protocols. Now, as we delve into the examination of our current state, let gratitude be our steadfast companion on this journey.



<n2>Visualisation</n2>
### Goals

Visualise having already achieved your long-term goals. Create a vision board, and add a number and label to each item. Split the board into long-term long-term goals and short-term long-term goals, ideally 12 months ahead.

Long-term goals: (1) Occupational goals such as eye surgeon, businessman and father. (2) Relationship goals such as a great relationship with parents, a loyal brotherhood and a large diverse network of skilled individuals, only female friends that I consider close family, and a devoted, loyal, loving partner. (3) Material goals such as a minimal ultramodern house with a beautiful scenic view, and a few supercars.

Short-term goals: (1) Achieve high marks, above 70%, in FFP exams. (2) Attain research positions and publications in the field of ophthalmology. (3) Build muscle and lose body fat.

Visualise yourself doing actions that will help you move closer towards these goals. If you don't know what actions to take, visualise yourself finding out. Visualise being successful with it.

### You Can Do This

<i>In the grand tapestry of life, gratitude reigns as our constant companion, a beacon of light guiding us through the labyrinth of challenges and aspirations. It is through gratitude that we uncover the hidden treasures strewn across our journey, enriching the very essence of our existence. 

Visualisation, a potent tool for sculpting our future, invites us to transcend the boundaries of our current reality. Picture, if you will, the attainment of your loftiest aspirations, each goal meticulously etched on the canvas of your mind. With unwavering resolve, forge a path towards these ambitions, for in visualisation, the seeds of success are sown. Envision the multifaceted facets of your life. Aspire to be not just an occupation, but an eye surgeon, a visionary businessman, a nurturing father. Cultivate not mere relationships, but deep connections with your parents, a loyal brotherhood, and a diverse network of talented souls.

As you embark on this journey towards your aspirations, let the spirit of generosity illuminate your path. Extend a helping hand to those in need, for in giving, you align with the cosmic forces that shape our destinies, elevating your consciousness to new heights. Intention, the driving force behind manifestation, lies at the heart of your journey. Channel your inner resolve to take decisive action, while allowing the outer intention to unfold the path towards your desired destination. Release the shackles of concern for when and how, focusing instead on the unwavering belief that your goals are already yours to claim. Embrace the notion that what you possess is both yours and yet transcends you, a gift to be shared for the betterment of all.

In the crucible of suffering, find the catalyst for transformation. Use your pain and trauma as stepping stones towards resolute decisions. Explore the depths of your desires and confront the resistance that surfaces. Embrace it, for it is the crucible in which your true self is forged.

Remember, it is not merely about what you can achieve or possess, but who you can become. Align yourself with the right path, and the right actions and possessions will follow suit. This, dear soul, is the mantra of your magnificent journey - a journey that begins with gratitude and unfolds through the power of visualisation, intention, and the unwavering belief that your destiny lies within your grasp. Embrace it with open arms, for your future awaits, resplendent with promise and potential.

Become the most successful man of your entire bloodline.</i>
