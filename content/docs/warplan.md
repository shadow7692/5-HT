<n2>Rules & Constraints</n2>
### Regulating

Within the domain of your daily routines and the unending pursuit of efficiency, it remains vital to keep in mind the existing rules and constraints concerning the various addictions and activities that deplete your time.

1. Moderate use of social media by checking YouTube and Instagram home/explore/reels once per day segment for a maximum of ten minutes. All other apps are to only be used for messaging people.
2. Do not expend energy on people who are not in my life.

### Thankfulness

Gratitude, a profound acknowledgement of the blessings within our lives, serves as an essential element in the ongoing refinement of our routines and protocols. Now, as we delve into the examination of our current state, let gratitude be our steadfast companion on this journey.

<n2>Goals</n2>
### Visualisation

Visualise having already achieved your long-term goals. Create a vision board, and add a number and label to each item. Split the board into long-term long-term goals and short-term long-term goals, ideally 12 months ahead.

Visualise yourself doing actions that will help you move closer towards these goals. If you don't know what actions to take, visualise yourself finding out. Visualise being successful with it.

Intention - inner intention (personal resolve to do something, go out there and take massive action, do do do - for those who are stuck in inaction and procrastination 99% of people) and outer intention (the resolve in my decision to have, no matter how it happens I am going to have it, it is done, and I have already assumed that its going to happen, operating from the end state of that assumption, how can I take the you from one side to the you, how does the movie go, because you already know the ending)
