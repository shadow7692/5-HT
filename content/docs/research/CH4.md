### Sexology

Mastery over sexual stamina requires proficiency in the following four domains: (1) achieving a balance in the power and tone of the pelvic floor muscles, (2) utilising diaphragmatic breathing, (3) developing a 'calm arousal' state of mind, and (4) conditioning the body through the practice of edging.

**1** As the male orgasm nears, the pubococcygeus muscle begins to tense. Therefore, actively relaxing the pubococcygeus muscle prevents the natural tension build up required for ejaculation. During orgasm, the bulbospongiosus muscle, or bulbocavernosus muscle, rhythmically flexes to empty the urethra. Therefore, tensing the muscle leads to faster ejaculation, though it results in a stronger erection. When an individual lacks muscle control, the bulbospongiosus and pubococcygeus muscles may contract involuntariy, relaxing the pubococcygeus can delay reaching the point of no return.

Firstly, an individual must learn to relax and contract both muscles independently by practicing the following four exercises, holding each contraction for 3 seconds and incrementally increasing the duration each week: (1) Front Pelvic Drops (Front Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if forcefully expelling urine faster during urination.
(2) Front Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle, as if halting the flow of urine mid-stream.
(3)Back Pelvic Drops (Back Reverse Kegels), which mimic the relaxation of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if pushing out flatulence.
(4) Back Kegels, which mimic the contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle, as if restraining bowel movement or holding in flatulence.

Depending on how imbalanced the pelvic floor already is, exclusively performing Reverse Kegels will allow overcorrection of the imbalance.

**3** A negative emotional state causes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and the consumption of pornography causes overstimulation, both of which lower the threshold to reach the point of no return.
