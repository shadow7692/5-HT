### Dentistry

Mechanical plaque control, achieved by creating friction between toothbrush bristles or Miswak plant fibers and the tooth surface, involves cleaning teeth with an electric toothbrush twice daily and using *Salvadora persica* sticks after every meal or snack. Toothpaste containing CoQ10 and Miswak contributes to chemical plaque control through the presence of calcium and fluoride ions, promoting the remineralization of tooth structure and exhibiting mild antibacterial properties.

*Salvadora persica*, commonly known as Miswak, offers a range of components with specific roles in oral health. Silica acts as an abrasive material, effectively removing stains and deposits from the tooth surface. Sodium bicarbonate provides a mild abrasive and germicidal effect, while tannic acid has an astringent effect on the mucous membrane. Resins form a protective physical layer over the enamel, guarding it against microbial action. Alkaloids exhibit bactericidal properties and stimulate the gingiva, essential oils act as antiseptics and enhance saliva production, similar to the effects of tea tree oil mouthwash. Additionally, vitamin C aids in the healing and repair process. This comprehensive approach helps to eliminate the biofilm of plaque, containing bacteria that secrete acid leading to enamel erosion and the formation of cavities, or causing gum infections such as gingivitis.

A tongue scraper removes the thin film of debris and bacteria that accumulates on the surface of the tongue. Gently scraping the tongue's surface reduces bacteria and foul odors.

Dental flossing plays a crucial role in oral health by cleaning the tight spaces between teeth and along the gumline that a toothbrush may not effectively reach. Dental floss removes food particles and plaque from these areas, preventing the formation of cavities and gum disease. It also promotes healthy gums by reducing the risk of inflammation and bleeding.

Salt gargling, a practice rooted in traditional medicine, involves rinsing the mouth with a warm saline solution. The saltwater rinse helps create an inhospitable environment for bacteria by altering the pH balance in the mouth. Additionally, it can soothe minor gum irritations and provide temporary relief from a sore throat or mouth ulcers.

### Dermatology

Moisturise daily and if incorporating retinol every other day into the skincare regimen, select moisturiser with SPF for optimal protection.

Shower daily, utilising soap to cleanse the entire body beyond mere hand and armpit gestures. Pay heed to the often-neglected zones: the nape, the ears, the feet, the ankles, and the back. Additionally, retract the foreskin and cleanse with the thumb, and spread the gluteal muscles apart and cleanse between. Use a scalp scrubber with shampoo and allow conditioner to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. Cleanse hands thoroughly after using the toilet. Take a cold shower and wash hands after engaging in physical activity at the gym.

Maintain tidiness with a nose hair trimmer and use tweezers to groom eyebrows. Paying close attention to the area just beneath the mandibular angle when shaving. Remove chest hair, tend to axillary hair with trimming, and manage pubic hair by shaving the testes and shaft, trimming the pubic region, and plucking thigh hair as needed. Ensure nails remain consistently trimmed.
