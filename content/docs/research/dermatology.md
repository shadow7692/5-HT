<n2>How To Implement The Perfect Skincare Routine</n2>
### Dermatology

Moisturise daily and if incorporating retinol every other day into the skincare regimen, select moisturiser with SPF for optimal protection.

Shower daily, utilising soap to cleanse the entire body beyond mere hand and armpit gestures. Pay heed to the often-neglected zones: the nape, the ears, the feet, the ankles, and the back. Additionally, retract the foreskin and cleanse with the thumb, and spread the gluteal muscles apart and cleanse between. Use a scalp scrubber with shampoo and allow conditioner to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off. Cleanse hands thoroughly after using the toilet. Take a cold shower and wash hands after engaging in physical activity at the gym.

Maintain tidiness with a nose hair trimmer and use tweezers to groom eyebrows. Paying close attention to the area just beneath the mandibular angle when shaving. Remove chest hair, tend to axillary hair with trimming, and manage pubic hair by shaving the testes and shaft, trimming the pubic region, and plucking thigh hair as needed. Ensure nails remain consistently trimmed.
