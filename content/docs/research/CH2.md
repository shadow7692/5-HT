<n2>Sculpting A Beautiful Body</n2>

### Arthrology

Maintaining joint mobility and muscle flexibility is crucial for prophylaxis against age-related orthopaedic conditions. The process of ageing involves cartilage and synovial fluid degradation, and reduced muscle elasticity, leading to issues such as osteoarthritis. *Surya Namaskar* is the routine of choice to target flexibility, strength, and balance, with origins traced back to the Vedic period in India. Each of the twelve poses in the cycle must be mastered to perfection to achieve optimal benefits, including eye movements and diaphragmatic breathing.
